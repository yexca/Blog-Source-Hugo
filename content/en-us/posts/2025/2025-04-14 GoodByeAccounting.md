## The Beginning: To Save Money and Gain Control

It all started very simply — I wanted to control my spending and build better financial awareness. And in the beginning, it really worked. I successfully curbed some of my bad spending habits.

## The Process: Stepping Into the World of Optimization and Card Collecting

Gradually, in pursuit of “better” consumption, I started comparing everything, looking for the optimal choice. At first, it was just comparing product prices. Later, it expanded to payment methods, tools, and eventually to bank promotions and card applications.

I applied for cards for discounts, then for convenience, and eventually just for collecting them. Step by step, I had fallen deep into the card-collecting world.

What started as saving money, turned into convenience, and ended up becoming card collecting.

## The Backfire: When Accounting Became a Burden

And so, accounting itself slowly became a burden. More and more accounts, more and more complex scenarios — the time cost and mental cost of bookkeeping had long exceeded its actual benefits.

There were times I spent hours researching just to save a few bucks. At first, that felt fun. But after doing it over and over, finding the optimal solution no longer excited me — it just left me feeling empty.

## The Change: From Seeking The Best to Seeking Comfort

Maybe I’ve changed. My approach to consumption has changed too.  
From “maximize savings” to “close enough, as long as I’m comfortable.”

I realized I had already broken through my original spending limits, yet I didn’t lose control. On the contrary, I came to understand more deeply: compared to saving money, my time and my happiness mattered more.

## The Reflection: Why Am I Even Keeping Accounts?

Because of bookkeeping, I started to:

- Constantly dig through records because I had too many accounts  
- Create new accounts in the app frequently due to currency conversions  
- Spend a long time hesitating over whether I should buy something  
- Have my mood ruined during outings with friends over spending details  

That made me reflect — Why am I even doing this?  
Is it really worth it for the so-called “gains” from bookkeeping?

## The Decision: Letting Go, Reset, Move On

So I tried to let go, to not fuss over the details, and simply asked myself:  
“Am I happy?”

And the result was — yes, I was really happy. And my spending wasn’t as high as I imagined either.

Perhaps my habits had already trained me to naturally compare prices. Or maybe, emotional value is something that can never be measured by discounts.

Therefore, I think it’s time to let go.

Accounting has fulfilled its mission.  
It’s no longer a tool, but a shackle.

Habits are meant to improve life.  
If they can no longer be sustained by passion, and instead get in the way of living, then it’s time to learn to say goodbye.

## The Ending: Thank You, and Keep Living

Giving up a habit I’ve maintained for two years is indeed a little bittersweet.  
But maybe this is also a part of life. Nothing stays with us forever, but as long as the time spent together was beautiful, that’s enough.

Perhaps I’ve lost a symbolic tool that made me feel like “I’m good at saving money.”  
But more than that, I hope my future self won’t rely on numbers and records for a sense of security, but instead, live with true ease and freedom.

From being in control, to flowing into the unknown.  
I hope I can adapt soon.  
And I hope I can spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and more joyful.

## The Last Entry, ¥0

Leaving a short note here.  
Thank you to myself for two years of dedicated tracking.  
From now on, I hope to spend the saved time on things that are more meaningful and joyful.

And just like that, I archived this experience.

Recording ends, but life is only just beginning.
