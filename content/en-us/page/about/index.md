Hello there! I'm [yexca /jɛːˈkɑ/](https://lit.link/yexca)

## Where?

Welcome to my personal blog! Think of this as my cozy little corner for jotting down what I’ve learned and explored. Lately, I’ve been sprinkling in some life musings too.

## What?

This blog is my **personal knowledge base**, where I record tricky problems and their solutions from my learning journey. Occasionally, I share some cool discoveries as well.  

Hopefully, these notes not only help me but also become your trusty sidekick in your own adventures! 🚀  

## Who?

Oh, you’ve clicked in, huh? Guess I owe you a proper intro.  

- A developer with a passion for exploring tech. I love trying out new stuff—right now, I’m sticking with classic B/S architecture, but hey, the future is wide open! (Cue the "Raise the flag" moment.)
- Big fan of sweet-sounding music. Lately, I’ve been looping [恋の押し売り](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YfQj2IlmY&si=4KdzRSsvDGNpm7u-). Sweet tunes are just the best! Even when the lyrics are kinda sad, as long as it’s paired with upbeat melodies like [空唄](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=BIL21F_HwgY&si=wjyZhahxAAabUwKD), it’s still amazing. Sweet melodies, FTW!

## The Dream

New roads are waiting for me, and more exciting things are just around the corner! ✨  

By learning, recording, and sharing, I hope to make life more colorful and boost my **subjective lifespan**.  

## What have I done so far?

Wow~ ⊙o⊙

Life’s like an adventure game—new maps, new quests every day. Sure, there are bugs here and there, but there are also countless treasures waiting to be discovered.
